The AdvDupe and E2 are given, feel free to edit what you like.

This thing shoots heavy balls at people. Yay physics! Careful people don't call you a prop pusher.

To use:
> Chat "target <player>" - The turret will continiously fire at the player with that name
> Chat "stop firing"     - The turret will stop targeting what it previously was
> You can also R+RMB with the HL2 revolver to fire at whoever's closest to where ever you're aiming.
